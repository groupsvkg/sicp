# SICP - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

# Building Abstractions with Procedures

## How ideas are made
- Combining several **_simple ideas_** into one compound one, and thus all **_complex ideas_** are made.
- The second is bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and setting them by one another so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets all its **_ideas of relations_**.
- The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence: this is called **_abstraction_**, and thus all its general ideas are made.

## Master software engineer
- Ability to **_organize programs_** for intended results
- **_Visualize_** system behaviour in advance
- Structure programs to be easily **_debuggable_**

## Well-designed systems
- Modular
- Parts can be separately
  - constructed
  - replaced
  - debugged
